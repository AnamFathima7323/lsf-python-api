Python wrapper for LSF APIs
===========================

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the Eclipse Public License.

This library allows you to call the LSF APIs from Python. The wrapper is created
by using SWIG. Some commands are left out and some typemaps are defined. 
Not all API calls are supported. Please see the following list for
tested and supported calls.

The following calls are tested and known to work reasonably well:

  Included from batch.h:
  * lsb_init
  * lsb_submit


  Included from lsf.h:
  * ls_info
  * ls_getclustername
  * ls_getmastername
  * ls_gethosttype
  * ls_gethostmodel 
  * ls_gethostinfo
  * ls_loadinfo
  * ls_load
  * ls_loadofhosts


The following calls are not tested:
  * ls_sharedresourceinfo 
  * ls_placereq
  * ls_placeofhosts
  * ls_loadadj
  * ls_eligible
  * ls_listrtask
  * ls_listltask
  * ls_insertrtask 
  * ls_insertltask
  * ls_deletertask
  * ls_deleteltask
  * all remote execution routines


The following calls are unknown:
  * ls_getmodelfactor
  * ls_gethostfactor


Convenient routines
-------------------

The following routines were added for your convenience:

  * get_load_of_hosts() - Return a list of hostLoad objects.
  * get_host_names()    - Return the name of the hosts in the cluster.
  * get_host_info()     - Return a list of hostInfo objects.
  * get_host_load()     - Return the current values for the resources of a host.
    Possible resource names (use lsf.<name>) values:

    R15S - 15s exponentially averaged CPU run queue length.
    R1M  - 1m exponentially averaged CPU run queue length.
    R15M - 15m exponentially averaged CPU run queue length.
    UT   - CPU utilization exponentially averaged over the last minute (from 0.0 to 1.0).
    PG   - Memory paging rate exponentially averaged over the last minute, in pages per second.
    IO   - Disk I/O rate exponentially averaged over the last minute, in KBytes per second.
    LS   - Number of users currently logged in.
    IT   - Idle time of the host (keyboard not touched on all logged in sessions), in minutes.
    TMP  - Available free disk space in /tmp, in MBytes.
    SWP  - Amount of currently available swap space, in MBytes.
    MEM  - Amount of currently available memory, in MBytes.


Notes
-----

  * You may need to set PYTHONPATH (pointing to the _lsf.so dir) and 
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly (LSF_LIBDIR needs to be included).

  * On Solaris use 'export LD_PRELOAD=libsocket.so.1' and 
    '/usr/bin/amd64/python'

  * ctypes are not used because the LSF libs tend to have undefined vars on 
    some platforms. The SWIG approach is more flexible with that issue.
